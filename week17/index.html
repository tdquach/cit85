<p>My name is Tan Quach and I am a student at Fresno City College.  The CIT-85 course was very helpful and I enjoyed taking it.  It is a good course for someone who would like to learn how to build and design a website.  The shortcuts learned were very useful and I will be using a lot of what I learned moving forward in my web development.</p></main>
