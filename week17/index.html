<p>My name is Tan Quach and this if my final for CIT 85.  I have taken some HTML and CSS courses and the past and this was a good refresher for me.  I also learned knew things that I did not know before.  All the new shortcuts that I have learned will be very useful moving on forward.  This class was very help and I enjoyed taking it.  It is a good course for someone who would like to learn how to build and design a website.</p></main>
